### **Testing Plan for the Telemetry Test Framework**

#### **1. Unit Testing**

**Objective:** Validate that each individual function and component of the framework works as intended.

**Files to Test:**

-   `pkg/process/process.go`
-   `pkg/fileops/fileops.go`
-   `pkg/network/network.go`
-   `pkg/logger/logger.go`

**Tests to Write:**

1.  **Process Module (`process.go`):**
    
    -   **Test Process Creation:**
        -   Validate that a process is started with the correct command-line arguments.
        -   Ensure the telemetry data (e.g., process ID, start time) is correctly captured.
    -   **Edge Cases:**
        -   Handle scenarios where the process fails to start.
        -   Test with various command-line arguments and ensure they are logged correctly.
2.  **File Operations Module (`fileops.go`):**
    
    -   **Test File Creation:**
        -   Validate that a file is created at the specified location.
        -   Ensure the telemetry data (e.g., file path, creation time) is accurately logged.
    -   **Test File Modification:**
        -   Validate that modifications to a file are captured, and the telemetry reflects the changes.
    -   **Test File Deletion:**
        -   Ensure that file deletions are logged correctly, including the time and the process responsible.
    -   **Edge Cases:**
        -   Handle cases where files cannot be created, modified, or deleted due to permission issues or other errors.
3.  **Network Operations Module (`network.go`):**
    
    -   **Test Network Connection:**
        -   Validate that a network connection is established to the specified address.
        -   Ensure that the telemetry captures the source and destination IPs, ports, and amount of data sent.
    -   **Edge Cases:**
        -   Handle scenarios where the connection fails or times out.
        -   Test various protocols (e.g., TCP, UDP) to ensure correct telemetry logging.
4.  **Logger Module (`logger.go`):**
    
    -   **Test Telemetry Logging:**
        -   Ensure that telemetry data is correctly written to JSON files with the expected filename structure.
    -   **Test Log File Creation:**
        -   Validate that files are created in the correct directory and are named using the appropriate convention.
    -   **Edge Cases:**
        -   Handle cases where the file cannot be written (e.g., due to a full disk or permission issues).

#### **2. Integration Testing**

**Objective:** Ensure that all modules work together as expected when integrated into a complete system.

**Scenarios to Test:**

1.  **Full Workflow Test:**
    
    -   Simulate a complete run of the framework, including process creation, file operations, and network connections.
    -   Ensure that all telemetry data is correctly captured, logged, and compared.
2.  **Cross-Module Interaction:**
    
    -   Validate that telemetry data generated by the `process`, `fileops`, and `network` modules is correctly passed to the `logger` module and written to files.
    -   Ensure that the `compare` module can accurately compare the generated telemetry data files.
3.  **State Management:**
    
    -   Test the ability to resume operations from the last saved state (`state.json`) after an interruption.
    -   Validate that incomplete operations are correctly resumed and that the state is accurately updated.
4.  **Cross-Platform Testing:**
    
    -   Run the framework on at least two of the three supported platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux).
    -   Ensure that all functionalities (process creation, file operations, network operations) work consistently across platforms.

#### **3. Performance Testing**

**Objective:** Evaluate the framework's performance under typical and extreme conditions to ensure it operates efficiently.

**Scenarios to Test:**

1.  **Load Testing:**
    
    -   Simulate a large number of process creations, file operations, and network connections to assess how the framework handles high loads.
    -   Monitor memory usage, CPU usage, and disk I/O to ensure the system remains responsive.
2.  **Stress Testing:**
    
    -   Push the framework to its limits by running multiple operations simultaneously or in rapid succession.
    -   Evaluate how the framework handles potential bottlenecks and whether it can maintain performance under stress.

#### **4. Robustness Testing**

**Objective:** Test the frameworkâ€™s ability to handle unexpected situations and recover gracefully.

**Scenarios to Test:**

1.  **Graceful Shutdown:**
    
    -   Simulate an abrupt shutdown (e.g., by sending a termination signal) and ensure the framework saves its state before exiting.
    -   Verify that the framework can resume correctly from the last saved state upon restart.
2.  **Error Handling:**
    
    -   Inject failures into various modules (e.g., simulate a failed process creation, file operation, or network connection) and ensure that the framework handles these errors gracefully without crashing.
    -   Ensure that errors are logged appropriately and that the framework can recover or retry operations as needed.

#### **5. Usability Testing**

**Objective:** Ensure that the framework is easy to use and that the documentation is clear and accurate.

**Tests to Perform:**

1.  **Documentation Review:**
    
    -   Ensure the `README.md` file accurately describes how to set up, run, and test the framework.
    -   Validate that the instructions are clear and that a new user can follow them without issues.
2.  **User Interface (CLI):**
    
    -   Test the command-line interface (if applicable) for ease of use, including argument parsing and error messages.
    -   Validate that all necessary options and configurations are easily accessible and understandable.

#### **6. Regression Testing**

**Objective:** Ensure that changes to the framework do not introduce new bugs or regressions.

**Steps to Follow:**

1.  **Automated Tests:**
    
    -   Implement continuous integration (CI) to automatically run unit and integration tests whenever changes are made to the codebase.
    -   Ensure that the CI pipeline catches any regressions introduced by new code.
2.  **Version Control:**
    
    -   Keep a record of previous versions of the framework and their associated tests.
    -   Regularly run regression tests against older versions to ensure new features do not break existing functionality.

### **Summary**

**Testing Goals:**

-   **Unit Tests:** Ensure individual components work correctly.
-   **Integration Tests:** Verify that the entire system functions cohesively.
-   **Performance Tests:** Confirm the framework performs efficiently under load.
-   **Robustness Tests:** Test error handling, recovery, and state management.
-   **Usability Tests:** Validate the user experience and documentation.
-   **Regression Tests:** Prevent the introduction of new bugs in future updates.
